### Overview
This README document outlines the development process, design rationale, prototype details, usability testing, and market research conducted for the Self-Care Canvas Integration project.

### Most Promising Idea
Our most promising idea is a platform integrated with college log-in pages (like Canvas) containing helpful resources and an interactive checklist of self-care tasks.

### Revised Tasks
- **Simple Task:** A checklist where students can add self-care activities and check them off when completed.
- **Medium Task:** A guide for students to see recommended self-care activities and create/check off their own tasks.
- **Original Complex Task:** An interactive college Canvas “course” for tracking self-care tasks, accessing resources, and event announcements.
- **Revised Complex Task:** An interactive college Canvas “course” for finding resources, tracking activities, and sharing progress with friends.

### Design Rationale
- **Integration:** Designed for seamless integration with various college log-in pages without visual clashes.
- **Inspiration:** Font and layout inspired by Canvas, with a light purple scheme for a calm atmosphere.
- **Customization:** Users can customize the color scheme for a personalized experience.
  
### Prototype Limitations
- Does not include functionalities of Canvas unrelated to the platform.
- Limitation in user input for journal logs and friend search due to Figma constraints.

### Usability Testing
- Conducted with paper prototypes focusing on navigation and task completion.
- Participants successfully completed tasks, with some feedback on UI intuitiveness.

### Market Research
#### Competitors:
- **Tangerine:** Focuses on habit formation and journaling, lacking social features.
- **Finch: Self Care Pet:** Niche app motivating self-care through pet care gamification.

### Discussion Insights
- Importance of developing unique features to stand out in a competitive market.
- Decision to prioritize Canvas integration for direct student engagement.
- Value of brainstorming multiple solutions and considering user perspectives.

### Conclusion
The UniWell project aims to provide college students with a comprehensive platform for managing self-care tasks efficiently within their academic environment. Further development will focus on refining the prototype based on usability testing feedback and market research insights.
