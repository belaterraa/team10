### Overview
This README document outlines the development process, design rationale, prototype details, usability testing, and market research conducted for the Self-Care Canvas Integration project.

### Introduction
Uniwell is an application that helps students keep track of their self-care tasks, receieve updates about events and resources offered by their school, and share their progress with friends. Uniwell is meant to be integrated into college log-on platforms like Canvas so that students can keep track of their self-care tasks and their school work all in one place.

### Revised Tasks
- **Simple Task:** A checklist where students can add self-care activities and check them off when completed.
- **Medium Task:** A guide for students to see recommended self-care activities and create/check off their own tasks.
- **Original Complex Task:** An interactive college Canvas “course” for tracking self-care tasks, accessing resources, and event announcements.
- **Revised Complex Task:** An interactive college Canvas “course” for finding resources, tracking activities, and sharing progress with friends.

### Storyboard
#### Simple Task Storyboard
Fred is a college student who has been super busy lately. He's been so busy that he's neglected some of his self-care tasks like showering. Fred added "showering" to his self-care checklist on his Uniwell page. While using Uniwell on Canvas to stay up to date with his classes, Fred also remembered to look at his checklist. Fred was reminded to shower and was able to better manage his self-care tasks.

#### Medium Task Storyboard
Julie is a freshman at FSU who does not own a car. Julie is having trouble finding ways to exercise and spend time outside since she can't travel off campus. Julie checked her Uniwell page to see if FSU provided any ways for students without cars to get off campus and she saw that FSU offered free buses to their Lakefront property. Juile added "go to the Lakefront" to her Uniwell checklist. At the end of the week Julie looked at her checklist and remembered to catch a bus to the Lakefront. This helped her get off camous for free and enojy the fresh air.

#### Complex Task Storyboard
Jordan is a senior at FSU who is struggling with senioritis. Jordan's advisor recomended that he use Uniwell to keep track of both his class work and his self-care tasks. After exploring the Uniwell syllabus and resources, Jordan saw a Uniwell annoucnement for a free yoga class on Landis. Jordan also noticed on the shared progress page that his friend set a goal to attend that same yoga class. Jordan then set a goal to attend. After utilizing his checklist, Jordan rememebred to attened the yoga class and crossed it off his list. Jordan then shared his task completion progress to update his friends and inspire them to complete their tasks.

### User Research Summary
We conducted our user research with paper prototypes and tasks that focused on navigation and task completion. For the most part, our participants were sucessful in completing each of our three tasks. Our particiapnts said that the design was intuitive and that it was easy to navigate back and forth between pages. Our largest piece of feedback across all users was that Uniwell needed more of its own features to stand out from existing Canvas features. That being said, we modified our revised complex task to include a "share" feature. This new share feature is unlike anything Canvas currently has implemented and will allow college students to share their self-care progress with friends. To further distinguish our app from Canvas we also named our app "Uniwell" and constructed a unique logo.

### Conclusion
The UniWell project aims to provide college students with a comprehensive platform for managing self-care tasks efficiently within their academic environment. Further development will focus on refining the prototype based on usability testing feedback and market research insights.
