### Overview
This README document outlines the development process, design rationale, prototype details, usability testing, and market research conducted for the Self-Care Canvas Integration project.

### Revised Tasks
- **Simple Task:** A checklist where students can add self-care activities and check them off when completed.
- **Medium Task:** A guide for students to see recommended self-care activities and create/check off their own tasks.
- **Original Complex Task:** An interactive college Canvas “course” for tracking self-care tasks, accessing resources, and event announcements.
- **Revised Complex Task:** An interactive college Canvas “course” for finding resources, tracking activities, and sharing progress with friends.

### Storyboard

### User Research Summary
We conducted our user research with paper prototypes and tasks that focused on navigation and task completion. For the most part, our participants were sucessful in completing each of our three tasks. Our particiapnts said that the design was intuitive and that t was easy to naviate back and forth between pages. Our largest piece of feedback across all users was that Uniwell needed more of its own features to stand out from existing Canvas features. That being said, we modified our revised complex task to include a "share" feature. This new share feature is unlike anything Canvas currently has implemented and will allow college students to share their self-care progress with friends.

### Conclusion
The UniWell project aims to provide college students with a comprehensive platform for managing self-care tasks efficiently within their academic environment. Further development will focus on refining the prototype based on usability testing feedback and market research insights.
